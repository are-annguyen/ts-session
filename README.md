Jim's Mowing has wants us to build a piece of software that will calculate the area of multiple mowing job request, and determine how much to charge the client.

They want the software to be able to sort the list of jobs from most expensive to least expensive and print out the jobs to the console. A sample of the list of jobs is listed in data.ts

Each lawn could have a shape of either square, triangle or circle. Each with a different shape has a different method of determining how much to charge the client.


- Quoting a square: total area x $10

- Quoting a rectangle: total area x $12

- Quoting a triangle: (total area x $5) + $100.



In the future, the specs if the program will expand to add:

- Additional shapes (each with their own method of determining price)

- Different sorting methods (cheapest to most expensive, highest to the lowest total area, etc)
